Great work overall.

Some good things: 
Super-sneaky cheating.
If I'm thinking about it correctly, it will NEVER cheat twice in a row - 
because starting at the beginning, it will only cheat if the user catches up
(though it WILL cheat on the very first game!  Criminal.)
(Cheating +0.5, in adjustments)

(RPSMatch.java lines 54-55) Using the constants ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS 
in your cheat code
   Make it better: also use the constants in getComputerText(), lines 118-122

Generating a who-wins message.
(Style +0.5, in adjustments)

You have some good Javadoc.  And some just random.  And some left from
BlueJ creating the class.  And some more just random.  Clean that up, please.
(no points off, because it wasn't required, but no bonus either).

Make it better: the "youWon" method name isn't very clear.
You're actually saying WHO won, not You won.

Great work overall!
